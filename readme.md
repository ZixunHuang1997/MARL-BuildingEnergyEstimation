# MARL: [M]ulti-scale [A]rchetype [R]epresentation [L]earning and Clustering for Building Energy Estimation
This repository is the implementation code of the paper "MARL: [M]ulti-scale [A]rchetype [R]epresentation [L]earning and Clustering for Building Energy Estimation" (arxiv, poster).

We present Multi-scale Archetype Representation Learning (MARL), a method designed to **automate local building archetype** construction through representation learning. Our proposed method addresses the aforementioned challenges by refining the essential elements of building archetypes for **Urban Building Energy Modeling**. This is a **learning-based** pipeline for representing and clustering buildings in our urban environment. Our research can be used in building energy estimation and can significantly save computing time. 

### Recent Updates:
